# Customer-Segmentation

## Problem Statement
You own a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. 

## Solution
Identify Target Customers so that the marketing team can plan campaigns around them. I've done this using the K-means algorithm.
